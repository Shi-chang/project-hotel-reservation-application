# Overview
This project is a hotel reservation application that allows the adminstrator to manage rooms and customers, and customers can find and book a hotel room based on room availability.

# What I have learned
1. The amazing power of application architecture, and how to apply different layers to achieve modularization and decoupling.
2. Enhanced abilities to design classes using OOP with Java.
3. More coding experience on organizing and processing data with collections.
4. More experience on handling potential illegal inputs from the user.

# Application Architecture
The UML diagram of the app is shown below.

Different layers were used to support modularization and decoupling. Layering was achieved by ensuring that there are no cross-communication calls from one layer to another.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the instructor of the course, Jeff Phillips from Udacity, for providing a clear and easy to understand course module.
